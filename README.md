# Stats Companion
A companion app for tracking [Final Fantasy VI: Worlds Collide](https://ff6worldscollide.com/) run statistics. It's designed to be as easy to use as possible, in other words, it "just works": just open the app and it will silently track your run data, so you'll finally know how long you've been sitting in menus juggling espers around!

### Special thanks:
- My friend and mentor, Ale. None of this would be possible without you <3.
- StatsCollide creator Seto Kiaba, for being the inspiration to Stats Companion.
- The Worlds Collide community and developers, for being the most amazing group of people. Special thanks to DoctorDT for putting up with me asking dumb questions about how things work, and my very early stage guinea pigs: Overswarm, HunnyDoo, RetrophileTV and gaahr.

## Requirements
- **[.NET Desktop Runtime 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)**
- **[SNI](https://github.com/alttpo/sni)** (Super Nintendo Interface) - if you're auto-tracking your run you probably already have this. It's not required but it's **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you update SNI to the latest version since it now features automatic reconnection.
- A device/emulator compatible with SNI. Both [**Snes9x-rr 1.60**](https://github.com/gocha/snes9x-rr/releases) and **[RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/) version 1.9.2 or higher** with bsnes-mercury core are working properly at the moment. Sd2snes is also supported.
